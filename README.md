## Project Inspiration:
The inspiration for this Tic Tac Toe project came from the desire to create my favorite childhood game but a version of it to beat addiction.  This project allowed me to delve into the world of AI a field I wasn't initially interested in and also gave me a deeper understanding of JavaScript when building the game logic.
