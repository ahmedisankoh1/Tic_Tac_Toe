            Ever since I was a kid, rainy afternoons meant fun Tic Tac Toe moments with my father. The thrill of outsmarting him, the strategic planning - it was more than just a game, they were my most cherished moments. But as I grew older, the challenge faded. Tic Tac Toe felt predictable, especially against friends who weren't as strategic. That's when I discovered the magic of Artificial Intelligence. Learning about algorithms like Minimax that could analyze games and make optimal moves reignited my passion for Tic Tac Toe. With the knowledge I gained from Holberton I was able to bring it to life. <br>
            This project, built for Holberton School's portfolio requirement https://www.holbertonschool.com/, became my chance to delve into AI and apply it to a classic game. My goal was to create a Tic Tac Toe game powered by Minimax and also checks on your health to decrease the chances of addiction, allowing players to test their skills against an AI opponent that learns and adapts.
